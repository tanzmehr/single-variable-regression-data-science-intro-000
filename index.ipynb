    "We then learned how to represent a line as a mathematical formula, and ultimately a function.  We describe lines through the formula $y = mx + b $, with $m$ representing the slope of the line, and $b$ representing the value of $y$ when $x$ equals zero.  The $b$ variable shifts the line up or down while the $m$ variable tilts the line forwards or backwards.  Translating this formula into a function, we can write a function that returns an expected value of $y$ for an input value of $x$."
