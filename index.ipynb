    "In this section, we saw how to estimate the relationship between an input variable and an output value.  We did so by drawing a straight line representing the relationship between a movie's budget and it's revenue.  We saw the output for a given input simply by looking at the y-value of the line at that input point of $x$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We then learned how to represent a line as a mathematical formula, and ultimately a function.  We describe lines through the formula $y = mx + b $, with $m$ representing the slope of the line, and $b$ representing the value of $y$ when $x$ equals zero.  The $b$ variable shifts the line up or down while the $m$ variable tilts the line forwards or backwards.  Translating this formula into a function, we can write a function that returns an expected value of $y$ for an input value of $x$."
